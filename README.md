OBF Homepage design

This is a design for the OBF homepage.

I have used HTML, CSS and JS for designing this. Currently, the design is done for the first 3 secctions of my layout, the about, news/blog and fellowships.
All the images used are free placeholder images.
I used mainly CSS for the design and some JS only for adding event handlers.
